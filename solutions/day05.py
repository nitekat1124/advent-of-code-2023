        benchmarks:
        part2_original:     661.71 Âµs
        part2_overlap_alt:  1.03 ms
        part2_reverse:      161.51 s

        notes:
        part2_original is my initial solution to this puzzle, it checks whether the current range
        overlaps with any map (there are four possible overlaps). if there is an overlap, the
        non-overlapping part will be put back into the remaining list to be checked for further
        examination later.

        part2_overlap_alt uses a different method to check and cut overlapping/non-overlapping
        ranges, which looks easier to read but runs slower. overall I think it's not much different
        from the part2_original.

        part2_reverse reverses the entire map, then starts from location 0 to check the value of
        seed and checks if it is in the range of seeds. I think this approach is very easy to
        understand, but runs way tooooooooo slow.
